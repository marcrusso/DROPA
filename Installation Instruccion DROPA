Welcome to the installation guide for DROPA. To begin with we need firstly to say that DROPA has been only tested in Ubuntu and because it use some line commands in Linux terminal (Bash) is only possible to use it on Ubuntu or any Linux version.

1) Python:

DROPA core is written in Python, specifically for Python 3.5. If you try lower version of Python it may have some problems. You can install Python directly from the Console with the command:
	
	sudo apt-get install python3

Once we had python installed we can proceed with the instalation of “pip”. Pip is a useful tool from python to install the packages that DROPA needs for running. The next command line would get you pip install (important to note that if you have more than one version of python it will probably not work, for this you need to consult directly on stackoverflow or other consulting website):  

	sudo apt install python3-pip

Once installed we can install all the different packages for the program. Here is the list of packages that you will need:
	
	- numpy
	- pandas
	- tqdm
	- intervaltree
	- matplotlib
	- upsetplot

for installing the package, you just have to type this in the console without the Apostrophes (“”)


	pip3 install “name of the package” 

Once installed all the packages we can continue with the next program necessary for DROPA

2) Bedtools

bedtools is also use in the core of DROPA, specifically for the creation of random data. To install bedtools we can use the console and type:

	sudo apt-get install bedtools

Once done we are ready to use the program.

3) Example

There is a test added to the program. for testing just write in the command line in the terminal where the Dropa is placed:

python3 DROPA_v2.0.py Test.DRIP_peaks.bed -a RefSeqAnnotation -o Test2 -rnaseq Test_RefSeq_Expression

For a shuffle just add "-shuffle X" at the end, where X is the quantity of desire shuffles
